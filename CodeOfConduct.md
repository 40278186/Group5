### 1. Purpose
The purpose of Group5 is, to the best of our ability, to adhere to the coursework requirements set out in the provided document [available here.](https://github.com/Kevin-Sim/set08103/tree/master/assessment)

### 2. Expected Behaviour
- Turn up to scheduled meetings on time
- Contribute equally
- Provide constructive criticism
- Treat others with respect

### 3. Unacceptable Behaviour
- Doing the opposite of point 2

### 4. Absence Policy
Any member absent from scheduled meetings, without notice of at least 1 hour, will reveive a written warning. In exceptional circumstances this warning will be waived.

3 written warnings will result in a poor peer assement form. In extreme cases, if necessary, the module leader will be notified.

### 5. Consequences
- Getting a roasting in the group chat
- Potential banishment from the team

### 6. Addressing Grievances
If something is bothering you, bring it up. We are adults and can talk about issues. As long as issues are addressed in a polite and grown-up manner, they can be worked out and resolved.
